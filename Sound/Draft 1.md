# Thoughts

1. Try different ffmpeg codecs w/ Matrix PON audio... \
Maybe something will eventually work with the presented bytestream.
2. Audacity -> RAW Stream -> 8bit unsigned PCM, 44100 -> playable simialr to music stream, but heavily compressed & distorted by the encoding/compression algorithm.
